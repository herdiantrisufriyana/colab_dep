## System requirements

To reproduce our work, a set of hardware requirements may be needed. We used a 
single machine. It was equipped by 8 logical processors for the 3.40 GHz 
central processing unit (CPU) (Core(TM) i7-4770, IntelÂ®, Santa Clara, CA, USA), 
and 16 GB RAM. But, one can use a machine with only 4 logical processors and 
4 GB RAM.

## Installation guide

Please follow through the R Markdown (colab_dep.Rmd). Installation 
approximately requires ~5 minutes.


## Demo

All codes require ~15 minutes to complete for non-expensive computation. We 
provided pre-existing files to substitute the expensive computation. One can 
set a variable that defines whether the expensive parts will be conducted. This 
may take hours to complete. (We embargo the dataset for a year from the 
publication date; thus, the pre-existing files will also be share after 
embargo period is over.)


## Instructions for use

Briefly, all system requirements, installation guide, demo, and instructions 
for use are available in R Markdown (colab_dep.Rmd) and other files in this 
repository.
